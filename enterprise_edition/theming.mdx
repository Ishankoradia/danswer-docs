description: 'Customize the look of Danswer'
---

As part of the Enterprise Edition, we provide the ability to easily customize the look of Danswer. This comes in two forms:

1. Adding in your own custom application name / logo.
2. Customizing every color in the UI.

### Customizing the Application Name / Logo

To provide your own application name / logo, you can use the `Whitelabelling` tab in the admin panel. Here, we provide a way to input
a name of your choice, as well as an optional logo.

#### Advanced Options

Danswer also has some advanced customization options

1. **Chat Header Content**
   Custom Markdown content that will be displayed as a banner at the top of the Chat page.

2. **Popup Header**
   The title for the popup that will be displayed for each user on their initial visit to the application. If left blank AND Custom Popup Content is specified, will use "Welcome to [Application Name]!" where application name is your filled in application name.

### Customizing Colors

We use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to theme Danswer. Every color used is one of 
defined in our [tailwind.config.js file](https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer/blob/main/web/tailwind-themes/tailwind.config.js).

To customize all these colors, you can:

1. Navigate to `web/tailwind-themes/custom`. 
2. Create a new folder with the name of your organization.
3. Create a `tailwind.config.js` file in this new folder.
4. Override any values in specified in the base `tailwind.config.js` file.
5. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_THEME` to the name of your organization (e.g. the same name as the folder you created in step 2).

For example, if you wanted to make the blackground black, you could use:

```
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */

module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        "background": "#000000",
      },
    },
  },
};
```

**NOTE:** for these changes to apply, you will need to build Danswer from source. If testing locally, you will need to restart the 
NextJS application to apply the changes.
