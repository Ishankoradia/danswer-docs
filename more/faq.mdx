## Contribution Questions

### Why did my PR Vercel build fail? or how can I see the vercel logs for my failed PR deployment? 
From the `/web` directory, run `npm run build` to see the error.

### When I change/upgrade authentication methods (e.g. OAuth or Email verification), no accounts are verified and thus can't log in?
Presuming that all your existing users are ones you want to keep in the system,
perform a one time database edit to mark all existing users as verified.

`UPDATE public.user SET is_verified = true;`

There will be a friendlier way of handling this in future releases.
