## Understanding Google Cloud Storage Structure

Google Cloud Storage organizes data into buckets. Each bucket can contain an unlimited number of objects (files). You can think of a bucket as a root directory, and the objects as files within that directory.

For more information on Google Cloud Storage structure, visit the [Google Cloud Storage documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs).
